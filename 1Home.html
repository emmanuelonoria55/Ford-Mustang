Henry Ford was an engineer from Detroit, Michigan who <br>
had an idea. By 1902, Ford had  attempted several times to<br> 
produce a gas powered vehicle, but with little capital, he<br> 
realized that his attempts were futile.  Ford approached a man<br> 
by the name of Alexander T. Malcomson about the possibility<br> 
of manufacturing an automobile.  Malcomson, a friend of the <br>
family and wealthy coal merchant was reluctant at first but<br>
finally agreed with Ford, and decided to assit Ford financially<br>
with his endeavor.  With Malcomsons investment and Ford's <br>
engineering skills a partnership was formed and in mid June <br>
of 1903, papers of incorporation for the Ford Motor Company <br>
were filed in Dearborn, Michigan.
